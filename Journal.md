# Journal
**This journal will serve as a record of my progress, allowing me to continually update and document my journey. Within its pages, I will document my accomplishments, such as doing CTF challenges, completing educational videos, etc. By consistently updating my process, I can track my growth, reflect on my achievements, and hopefully it will be a motivation or an example as a path to follow to those who are getting into this exciting field.**
