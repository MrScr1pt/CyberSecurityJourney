# Journal
**This journal will serve as a record of my progress, allowing me to continually update and document my journey. Within its pages, I will document my accomplishments, such as doing CTF challenges, completing educational videos, etc. By consistently updating my process, I can track my growth, reflect on my achievements, and hopefully it will be a motivation or an example as a path to follow to those who are getting into this exciting field.**

Completed [Beginner picoMini 2022](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?originalEvent=69&page=1&search=), there was 13 challanges. Gained a good amount of tips and some knowledge about python programming, error solving, hash/password cracking, etc. Due to my previous experiences in CTFs, Cyber Security, programming that I gained before actually deciding to document my process and start this project, [Beginner picoMini 2022](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?originalEvent=69&page=1&search=) was not that challenging. Also wrote a small code in python to [md5 hash text](/Codes/Python/md5_hash.py).
