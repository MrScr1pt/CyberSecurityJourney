# Cyber_Security_Journey
Welcome to my cyber security learning journey! This repository is my documentation of the progress I'm making as I learn and acquire skills in the exciting field of cyber security. Following the roadmap from roadmap.sh, I'm working through different topics and milestones to build a solid foundation in cyber security. I'll also be uploading cheat sheets, tips, useful codes/programs, etc. I hope that these will be useful for those who also want to get into Cyber Security and a motivation to start.
